<h1>Vulnerability Management with Nessus</h1>

<b>The primary goal of this project is to establish a Vulnerability Management Lab, either on a local machine or in Azure. The key steps involve setting up a virtual environment, installing Nessus Essentials, configuring a virtual machine, installing deprecated software, and conducting vulnerability scans. The subsequent actions include identifying vulnerabilities, remediation, and verification through additional scans to ensure a secure environment.
</b>
<br />
<h2>Importance</h2>
<b>Vulnerability Management is a crucial practice in Information Security. By continuously assessing assets, discovering vulnerabilities, and remediating them, organizations can maintain a lower overall risk. The project emphasizes the significance of implementing Vulnerability Management in every organization's security strategy.
